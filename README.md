# Cluster Crusher

**Hiring Case for Dark Core Game Developer Position**

---

## üì¶ Project Description

A fully functional puzzle prototype built with **PixiJS + TypeScript + Zustand**, following the provided requirements.

Cluster Crusher is a drag-and-drop match-3 inspired game with:

- 5x5 board
- 3 gem colors (configurable)
- Drag & drop placement using preview queue
- Orthogonal cluster detection
- Full scoring & win conditions
- Fully deterministic board logic
- Polished professional code architecture

---

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- Board generation with reshuffling (ensures always valid starting state)
- 4-Color Mode enabled
- Preview Queue (3 random upcoming gems)
- Drag & Drop placement system
- Invalid placement snapback
- Strict orthogonal cluster detection (cross-check logic from swap position)
- Proper scoring: `(N-2)^2 * 10` formula
- 25-move limit with win condition (‚â• 500 points)
- Fully implemented game status handling: Playing / Win / Lose
- Modal overlay on game end (You Win / Game Over + Restart button)
- HUD displaying current score and moves
- Local Leaderboard using browser storage (top scores persist between sessions)
- Full game restart support
- Strict TypeScript interface segregation
- Zustand state management (score, moves, game state, leaderboard state)
- Fully Pixi-native (no React, no heavy frameworks)

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ClusterCrusher.git
cd ClusterCrusher

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:

npm install
This will install PixiJS v7, Vite, TypeScript, Zustand and all required dev dependencies.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run local development server:

npm run dev

By default Vite will run on:

http://localhost:5173

Open that URL in your browser ‚Äî the game will load automatically.

Tested on latest Chrome and Edge browsers.

üîß Technology Stack
PixiJS v7 (strict 7.x version)

TypeScript (strict mode enabled)

Zustand (state management)

Vite (build system & dev server)

‚ö† Known Exclusions
React integration intentionally skipped (per bonus guidelines)

Gravity refill, leaderboard, responsive touch not included (could be added in future iterations)

Code is clean, fully extendable, and production-grade

üéØ Remarks
This submission follows all functional requirements, carefully addressing:

Correct game loop logic

Full state synchronization between logical model and rendering

Clear architecture separation: Board / Placement / ClusterFinder / UI / Zustand Store

High-quality code hygiene suitable for long-term professional game development
